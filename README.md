  Implement a 2-tier architecture in AWS, Azure, or GCP using Terraform ðŸš€

## Architecture Diagram 


## Objective
In this project task, we aim to leverage infrastructure as code (IaC) best practices to create a reusable and shareable infrastructure setup. Our focus is on promoting modularity, flexibility, and maintainability.

## Key Guidelines

### 1. Leverage Custom Modules
Build custom modules to break down your infrastructure code into reusable and shareable components. This approach not only makes your code more organized but also allows other team members to easily incorporate and adapt the components for their specific needs.

### 2. Use Variables and Data Sources
Implement variables and data sources in your IaC code to enhance flexibility and maintainability. Variables make it easier to adapt and modify configuration settings, while data sources allow you to retrieve information from external sources to inform your infrastructure.

### 3. Remote State File
Store your state file remotely. This practice enhances collaboration, security, and version control of your IaC code. Consider using a remote state storage service provided by your infrastructure as a code platform, such as Terraform Cloud or AWS S3.

### 4. Security First
Keep security in mind throughout your IaC development. Ensure that your infrastructure is configured with appropriate security measures, adhering to best practices for secure and compliant deployments.

By following these guidelines, you'll create an infrastructure setup that is not only efficient but also highly adaptable and secure.
